# LeetCode Solutions in Python and SQL

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions. Doing leetcode questions is one of my favorite ways to learn new things. Here, you'll find some leetcode questions solved. 

Currently, I'm working on solving problems in Python and SQL. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by LeetCode problem numbers:

- **python/**: Contains Python solutions.
- **sql/**: Contains SQL solutions.

Each problem is named by its LeetCode problem number.


## How to Navigate

- For Python solutions, look inside the `python/` directory.
- For SQL queries, head to the `sql/` directory.
